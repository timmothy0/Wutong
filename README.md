My first time joining in data mining competition, I wanna record what I have learned from this competition and share my experience.

Knowledge learned during this competition as following:

1.better understanding about lgm parameters

2.how to deal with unbalanced data

3.adjusting threshold works!(but I didn't do that...)

4.stacking feature learned from kaggle

5.how to use pseudo-labelling

留有遗憾，希望下次更好！
